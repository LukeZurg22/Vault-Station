==================DOORS, FLOORS & WALLS==================
Wooden Door (Secret :: Wooden Wall)

Blast door, but looks wooden
-> Also has legend of zelda ding-ding-doo-ding opening sound

Some Fundamentally indestructable:
* Walls
* Windows
* Doors (w. walls)

Slanted Solid-Reinforced Wall (theres only solid)

Add new Circuit Floor colors (orange, purple, yellow)

Directional-window-sized walls that aren't see-through

Slanded Stone (necropolis) walls

========================AI / DUNGEON MASTER========================
Set AI default laws to dungeon master mode

Set AI playtime requirement to minimal. Something that doesnt take forever to unlock but must be unlocked. (4 hours?)

Change AI default description to "Warning: May narrate in comical voices."

Change AI Core default name to "Vault Intelligence"

Allow AI to spawn enemies, but on an incredibly long cooldown.
-> Maybe at the cost of some kind of resource?
-> Check if AI cursor is over all. If so, then don't do anything. Otherwise, proceed with spawning and countdown.

Change UI overlay to be "DM" or "GM"

As Dungeon Master, AI's primary goal is to have fun and make the game fun for the venturers but still antagonize them.

============EVACUATION AND "CENTRAL COMMAND"============
Make Comms Shuttle console able to be called by anyone.
-> Make custom console with just one button "Call Pickup / Valkerie / Eagle" (name pending) that calls evac.
-> Cannot be undone!
-> Also plays tense get-away music.

Set EVAC shuttle to be much quicker than normal, and everyone has to RUN THROUGH THE DUNGEON TO GET TO IT

Make CentComm some sort of Midieval fantasy-esque tavern with a mix of high-tech and not-tech.

Make Nuclear-disk equivalent item; something super important that needs to be brought to the end and is highly coveted.
- Really good for making competitive teams


============WEAPONS============
Some flavors of weapons:
- Claymore (low distance high damage)
- Pike (more distance low damage)
- Rapier (good all-rounder)

============ENEMIES============
Turrets that can be easily destroyed
Boss enemies that must be killed as a preemptive condition to the dungeon

============OTHER MISCELLANEOUS TODO============
No-Smoking sign, except it's a "Keep Smoking" sign with a green checkmark.

Sprite for Random Curtain spawner

Alternate-rotated bed sprite (I REALLY want my vertical bed)

Make maps take place on a planet with atmospherics. Solves a lot of the problems with atmos handling.

Corner grass w. dark steel tiles

Nitrogen Wall-Closets (they dont exist)

Magic Conch Shell from SpongeBob:: Math.Random?

Custom join-in roles instead of "passenger" and etc.
- Fighter (Fundamentally worse at aiming. Like Oni's in Frontier)
- Medic (Medical supplies. Maybe faster at it, who knows.) Not good at Ranged nor Melee weapons.
- Ranger (Can actually use ranged weapons but isn't so good in melee)


Midieval esque posters or old-timey maps

Party collect money and whatnot in the dungeon before delivering it to a container that tallies up the total like a kind of "high score"

============BACKBURNER============
Lights entirely disabled in a dungeon. An item will power all unpowered lights nearby.
-> But it doesn't last long.
